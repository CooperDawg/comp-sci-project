            have no penalty to defend against
            attacks from the sides or rear. You can
            attack foes to your sides or rear without making a Wild Swing, but you are
            at -2 to hit due to the clumsy angle of
            attack (note that some Karate techniques do not suffer this penalty).

            Shadowing attempts, and are never
            surprised by a danger that comes from
            behind, unless it also is concealed
            from sight.
            Extra eyes are merely a special
            effect of this trait – you can have any
            number of eyes, but the point cost

            New Special Enhancements
            
            (1)Panoptic 1: You can see all around
            you without turning your head and
            without the need for extra eyes. This is
            an enhancement because your gift
            isn’t obvious – you can visibly stare in
            one direction and actually be looking
            in another! You still need eyes,
            though. If you’re blindfolded, dazzled,
            blinded by injuries, etc., you cannot
            see. +20%.
            
            (2)Panoptic 2: As above, but you don’t
            need eyes. You can always perceive
            everything going on around you, even
            if blinded or blindfolded. You still
            need light, unless you have something
            like Dark Vision. Blows to the eyes
            injure you normally but won’t blind
            this sense. +60%.
